# Final project for Programming I.

**Objective:**
Create a *Home Inventory* program for an international builder.

### Requirements
**Attributes**
- sf
- address
- city
- state
- zip
- model 
- sale status

**Methods**
- Add home
- Remove home
- Udate home 
- Display homes

### My Solution
*Still a work in progress*

Two classes; one creates the information of each home, and the other holds a list of all the objects from the other class.

Home class (creates each home) contains all the attributes including the setters/getters

HomeInventory (Holds objects from the Home class into an ArrayList, so the actual inventory of the program) this is where most of the logic for the program is.

Lastly The Main.java file is where everything is executed and contains a few other methods (print to a text).
