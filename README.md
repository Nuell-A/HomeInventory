# Final project for Programming I.

**Objective:**
Create a *Home Inventory* program for an international builder.

### Requirements
**Attributes**
- sf
- address
- city
- state
- zip
- model 
- sale status

**Methods**
- Add home
- Remove home
- Udate home 
- Display homes

### My Solution

Two classes; one holds the information of each home, and the other holds a list of all the objects from the first class.

 - Home class (creates each home) contains all the attributes including the setters/getters

 - HomeInventory (Holds objects from the Home class into an ArrayList, so the actual inventory of the program) this is where most of the logic for the program is.
